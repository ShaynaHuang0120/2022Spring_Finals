## Project Overview: 
Type: 1 - Formal Critique and Improvement of a Published Data Analysis:

In this project, we utilized one of the previous final projects in IS 597PR as the starting point. We found that the original 
work had problems with coding, corresponding analyses, and many other types of issues. Besides, revising and improving the original work,
we also developed our own new hypotheses and analyses on the new dataset and data source, making the original topic a broader one.

## Repository Description & Instruction
### Folders:
- data: Datasets we apply through all python file and Jupiter Notebooks
- image: All the pictures generated and shown in the Jupiter Notebooks
- presentation: The PowerPoint file (slides) used for the final presentation




### Files in main:
- README.md: Overview of the project and the end-user instructions
- Hypothesis - xxx: Jupiter Notebooks to illustrate each hypothesis' code
- Exploratory_Analysis_Constructors_Groups: A Jupiter Notebook analyzing the car constructors and groups in F1 and Formula E.
- final_report: A comprehensive report to describe all of our research and findings
- final_func.py: Functions used for data analytic and visualization

### User Instruction
- Each hypothesis Jupiter Notebook presents the coding part and the output
- To view our results as a whole, please read the final_report in which we presented all of our analyses, visualizations, and
conclusions in sequence.
- To view our coding part, Jupiter Notebooks can be a starting point and all functions used in notebooks are stored in final_func.py
