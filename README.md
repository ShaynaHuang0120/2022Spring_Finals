   1. Hypothesis: Fewer pit stops give the driver a better rank in each race 
   2. Hypothesis: The pit stops are evenly distributed 
   3. Hypothesis: Evenly distributed pit stops give better race results

## 1. Pit Stop Strategies

### 1.1 Hypothesis: Fewer pit stops give the driver a better rank in each race

### 1.2 Hypothesis: The pit stops are evenly distributed through time

As shown, for each number of pit stops a team chose for the entire race, there appears to be a pattern in when they chose to pit. If the team chooses to pit only once in the entire race, they usually pit at the half of the race. If the team chooses to pit twice, they usually pit when it's near 1/3 and 2/3 of the total laps. The case is similar if they choose to pit thrice. 

Noticing this pattern, we came up with the second hypothesis that the pit stops are evenly distributed through time. Our null hypothesis is that all pits are normally distributed around the points the evenly dividing points (1/2, 1/3, 2/3, etc). 

To study such a pattern, we calculated the proportion of the total laps the driver pit at for each record in the racing results. For convenience, we call this proportion 'Lap Proportion'.
Before we start, there is one property of the Lap Proportion column that we should notice. The numeric range of the Lap Proportion is not ideally continuous. The range of values the Lap Proportion can take is actually a discrete set because the domains of values that the numerators and the denominators (i.e. laps and total laps) can only be chosen from two very limited sets. Due to the discrete nature of the data, the Lap Proportion data, grouped by any number of total pit stops, is not normally distributed by strict definition. 

However, the distribution statistics of these groups resemble the characteristics of normal distributions very well: All the data groups are distributed symmetrically around the mean, with around 68% falling within one standard deviation, and with around 95% falling within two standard deviations. It would also be intuitive that such a distribution would follow a distribution similar to the normal distribution. Hence, we only assume that pit stop time points of each group are normally distributed given a broader definition. 

Assuming these groups of data are normally distributed, we notice that the means deviate quite a bit from the ideal dividing points (1/2, 1/3, 2/3, etc.). Using one sample T-Tests, we calculated the p values for each group, and the results show that all the p values are significantly lower than the significant level of 0.05, with differences of at least 20 orders of magnitude.

In conclusion, we reject the null hypothesis and determine that the time points of the pit-stopping are not evenly distributed.


### 1.3 Hypothesis: Evenly distributed pit stops give better race results

We are also interested in whether the racing results are influenced by the pit stop distributing strategies, 
so we hypothesize that the evenly distributed pit stops give better race results. 

From the plots above, we can tell that the pit distributions of the higher ranking results are more evenly distributed across the entire race than the lower ranking results. The differences are also statistically significant given an alpha of 0.05 for the first and the last pit stop if the driver pits three times in a race.

We can also use the average distance of how far the lap proportions are away from the evenly divided points, 
grouping them by each race and each driver so that we can treat the pit distributing strategy of each race as a whole.
Similarly, we compare the results of higher ranking drivers with the lower ranking drivers and test them with Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test, resulting in a p-value of 0.001, meaning that the test is significant against the 0.05 significance level.


Thus, we concluded that we accept the hypothesis that the evenly distributed pit stops give better racing results.
