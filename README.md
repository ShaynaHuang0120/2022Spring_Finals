## Project Overview: 
Type 1 - Formal Critique and Improvement of a Published Data Analysis:

In this project, we utilized one of the previous final projects in IS 597PR as the starting point. We found that the original 
work had problems with coding, corresponding analyses, and many other types of issues. Besides, revising and improving the original work,
we also developed our own new hypotheses and analyses on the new dataset and data source, making the original topic a broader one.

### User Instructions:
- Each hypothesis Jupiter Notebook presents the coding part and the output
- To view our results as a whole, please read the final_report in which we presented all of our analyses, visualizations, and
conclusions in sequence.
- To view our coding part, Jupiter Notebooks can be a starting point and all functions used in notebooks are stored in 
[final_func.py](https://github.com/TianciZheng/2022Spring_Finals/blob/main/Final%20Report.md).
- For our dataset, we have included all necessary data files in the "data" folder.
You can also choose to download them from the links in Dataset Source Section. Make sure you still put all the downloaded files into
a folder named "data" to run all programs and notebook successfully.
